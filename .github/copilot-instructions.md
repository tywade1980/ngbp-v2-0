# Copilot Instructions for ngbp-v2-0

## Project Overview

This repository (`ngbp-v2-0`) appears to be a foundational project setup. Based on the naming convention, this may be related to an Angular Boilerplate (ngbp) version 2.0, but the current state suggests it's in early development stages.

## Repository Context

- **Current State**: Minimal repository with basic README
- **Structure**: Simple project structure with potential for growth
- **Purpose**: To be determined based on future development

## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Follow existing patterns and conventions when they emerge
- Maintain consistency with any established project structure
- Document significant changes and decisions

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Ensure proper error handling

### File Organization
- Organize files logically as the project grows
- Use appropriate directory structures for the chosen technology stack
- Keep configuration files in appropriate locations (root or .config directories)

### Documentation
- Keep README.md updated with project status and setup instructions
- Document any setup or installation procedures
- Include examples for common use cases as they develop

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Understand the current project state
2. Identify the technology stack being used
3. Check for existing build tools, linters, or test frameworks
4. Review any existing documentation

### When Adding Features
1. Follow established patterns if they exist
2. Add appropriate tests when a testing framework is present
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Consider backward compatibility

### Pull Requests
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages
- Update relevant documentation
- Test changes thoroughly

## Technology Stack Notes

As the project evolves, update this section with:
- Primary programming languages used
- Frameworks and libraries
- Build tools and package managers
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment procedures

## Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Start Small**: Make incremental changes rather than large refactors
2. **Follow Conventions**: Once patterns are established, follow them consistently
3. **Test Early**: Add tests as soon as a testing framework is established
4. **Document Changes**: Keep the README and other docs up to date
5. **Ask Questions**: If unsure about project direction, ask for clarification

## Common Tasks

As the project develops, add common commands and procedures here:

```bash
# Example commands (to be updated based on actual project needs)
# npm install          # Install dependencies
# npm run build        # Build the project
# npm test             # Run tests
# npm run lint         # Run linter
```

## Project-Specific Notes

- This project is in early stages of development
- Technology stack and structure may evolve significantly
- Keep instructions updated as the project matures
- Be prepared to adapt to changing requirements
